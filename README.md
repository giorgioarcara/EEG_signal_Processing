# EEG SIGNAL PROCESSING

This repository contains several scripts that explain some basic concepts in Signal Processing applied to EEG. Most of the code is inspired (or is an adaptation) of the code written by Mike Cohen and accompanying his book "Analyzing Neural Time series". 
However there could be some differences that reflect my personal knowledge on signal processing. 

I wrote those script manily to help myself have a better grasp on some basic (and crucial) concepts in EEG.

All scripts are provided without any warranty.
